# 🚀 Argo Simulation Study Guide
### *Build and apply simulations for business, physics, and real-world systems using Sine, Derivatives, Fourier, and Trajectories*

---

## 🧭 Overview
Argo is a simulation engine that uses math and code to model real-world behavior in business and science. This guide combines foundational lessons, real-world applications, code, and UI/API integration strategies.

---

## 📘 Lessons Included

### ✅ Lesson 1: Sine & Cosine — Cycles, Motion, and Real-World Rhythm
### ✅ Lesson 2: Derivatives — Measuring Change in Motion, Money, and More
### ✅ Lesson 3: Projectile Motion — The Parabolic Path of Forces in Motion
### ✅ Lesson 4: Fourier Analysis — Turning Complexity into Cycles
### ✅ Lesson 5: Simulation Scenario — Combining Waves, Motion, and Change

---

## Lesson 1: Sine & Cosine
- **What it is**: Describes repeating cycles — used in audio, seasons, UI motion, and signals.
- **Formula**: \( y = A \sin(Bx + C) \)
- **Code**: Python with `numpy` and `matplotlib`
- **Real Use**: Modeling attention cycles, market waves, character animation

---

## Lesson 2: Derivatives
- **What it is**: Instantaneous rate of change; tells you how fast something is changing.
- **Formula**: \( f'(x) = \frac{df}{dx} \)
- **Code**: `sympy.diff()` and `scipy.misc.derivative`
- **Real Use**: Profit per user, speed of reaction, AI gradient descent

---

## Lesson 3: Projectile Motion
- **What it is**: Simulates motion of a thrown object
- **Formula**: \( y = x \tan(\theta) - \frac{gx^2}{2v^2 \cos^2(\theta)} \)
- **Code**: Simulates arcs with `matplotlib`
- **Real Use**: Physics launches, game dev jumps, business arc of effort/returns

---

## Lesson 4: Fourier Analysis
- **What it is**: Breaks signals into sine and cosine components
- **Tool**: `scipy.fft`, `numpy.fft`
- **Real Use**: Audio filtering, trend analysis, fault detection, marketing rhythms
- **Visualization**: Time-domain vs frequency-domain graphs

---

## Lesson 5: Full Simulation Scenario
Simulate a real-world **AI product launch**:
- Attention = sine wave
- Conversion = quadratic curve
- Conversion rate = derivative
- Feedback = Fourier analysis

**Integrated Code Includes**:
- Real-time graph of engagement and campaign effectiveness
- Frequency response graph using FFT
- Interactive slider idea (velocity, angle, frequency)

---

## 💻 Developer Integration
### Streamlit GUI
- Live sliders for launch velocity, angle, trend frequency
- Real-time plotting with `matplotlib`

### FastAPI Backend
- `/simulate/` endpoint with Pydantic models
- Returns conversion curves and FFT feedback

### Dashboard + Storage
- Track multiple scenarios via Firebase/PostgreSQL

### AI Strategy Tuner (Optional)
- Use `scikit-learn`, `optuna`, or GPT-4 function calls to optimize campaigns
