# ðŸŽ¯ Lesson 3: Projectile Motion â€” The Parabolic Path of Forces in Motion

## âœ… What It Is â€” Plain English

**Projectile motion** describes the curved path an object follows when launched into the air, under the influence of gravity.

- The path is a **parabola** (like a rainbow or a ball arc).
- It combines **horizontal motion** (constant speed) and **vertical motion** (changing due to gravity).

Formula:
\[
y = x \tan(\theta) - \frac{g x^2}{2 v^2 \cos^2(\theta)}
\]
