# 📉 Lesson 2: Derivatives — Measuring Change in Motion, Money, and More

## ✅ What It Is — Plain English

A **derivative** tells you how fast something is changing *right now*.
- It’s like asking, “What’s your speed *at this exact moment*?”
- The steeper the curve, the faster the change.

Mathematically: it’s the **slope** of a curve at a single point. 

Symbolically:
\[ f'(x) = \frac{df}{dx} \]
